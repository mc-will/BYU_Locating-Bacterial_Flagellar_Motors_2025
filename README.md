# Welcome to LOMBA!

LOMBA is the french acronym for 'Locating Bacterial Flagellar Motors'. 

This is the repo for the group project of Le Wagon Data Science batch #1992.

## Description
We used the data for the [BYU - Locating Bacterial Flagellar Motors 2025](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/byu-locating-bacterial-flagellar-motors-2025).

TODO

## Our implementation
We reduced the scope of the challenge by:
  - considering only tomograms with 0 or 1 motor
  - tomograms with shape x<960, y<960 to ease preprocessing
  - we increased the prediction threshold from 1000 to 2000 angstrom
